Framework for Real-time collaboration on extensive Data Types using Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC)

This project emerged as part of my research master thesis at the University of Montreal, where I successfully graduated in January 2019.
For an in-depth exploration, you can access the complete thesis paper [here](https://papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca/xmlui/handle/1866/22532).

CollabServer is a sophisticated framework designed for real-time collaboration on extensive data types, such as Graph.
Leveraging CRDT, it ensures concurrency without the need for manual conflict resolution.
It's important to note that while this framework represents a significant contribution to research, it is not recommended for production code due to its experimental nature.
